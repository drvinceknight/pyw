## Some Python

#### Jupyter versus scripts

- Why/when should I use either?
- This is an often spoken about topic:

#### Tools for Modularisation

- `def`
- `import`
- `assert`
- `if __name__ == "__main__":`
- `dir`

#### Some python "tricks"

- `enumerate`
- `zip`
- Arrays in python

#### Don't write code
